NiBabel
Read / write access to some common neuroimaging file formats

This package provides read +/- write access to some common medical and neuroimaging file formats, including: ANALYZE (plain, SPM99, SPM2 and later), GIFTI, NIfTI1, NIfTI2, MINC1, MINC2, MGH and ECAT as well as Philips PAR/REC. We can read and write FreeSurfer geometry, annotation and morphometry files. There is some very limited support for DICOM. NiBabel is the successor of PyNIfTI.
