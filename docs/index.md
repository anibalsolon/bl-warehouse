Brain-Life Warehouse allows you to organize / archive datasets, register application and process data.

TODO .. please edit this page with a bit more polished content.. 

## Archive

Warehouse takes care of long term curation of data imported by user, and data generated by data processing organized by *project*. *Project* can either be public, or private. If private, only the project members can download / process data. Public project allows anyone registered on Brain-Life to download and process data. Archived data is stored in Jetstream Object Store and copy of the data is also stored on IU SDA / HPSS system. In order to process data stored in archive, data must first be staged out of the Object Store and moved to Brain-Life's scratch disk (spinning disk).

## Browsing Data

User can search / view / download datasets stored in the warehouse for projects that they have access to.
